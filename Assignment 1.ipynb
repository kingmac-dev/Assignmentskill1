    "The conventions being followed while declaring a variable are as follows\n",
    "\n",
    " Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore, or non-number character.\n",
    " Variable names should be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    " Variable names follow the same convention as function names.\n",
    " Variable names are case-sensitive. \n",
    " MixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.\n",
    "  In Python, variable names follow the snake_case naming convention as per the PEP8 style guide. This means that all words in the name are in lowercase, and each word is separated by an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of good variable names in Python:\n",

    " In Python, you cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier1. Keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning in the language and are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language1. If you try to use a keyword as a variable name, you will get a syntax error. For example, if you try to use the keyword if as a variable name like this:\n"
